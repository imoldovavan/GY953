# GY953
A library for the Tilt compensated compass GY-953

The GY-953 it's a tiny Tilt Compensated compass module based on a sensor and a onboard 32 CPU from ST. The board works in serial or SPI mode.
This library handle only the SPI version.
The reason I wrote this is simple, cannot find any documentation and the module seems be copied 1:1 from a solution appears time ago on the net, maybe the chinese who copied don't want to expose himself...
